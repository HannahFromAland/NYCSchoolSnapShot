In the past few years, there has been multiple incidents relating ethnicity inequalities. For example, George Floyd’s tragedy led to a wave of “Black Lives Matter” champaign; the death of Chinese student at Chicago university revealed a series of discriminating activities against Asian international students. Given the prevalent problem presenting in the society, we hypothesized that discrimination originate from poverty levels. Thus, we aim to gain more insights about racial inequalities by investigating the distribution of ethnicity and other indicators in schools in New York. In this way, we can determine if racial inequality exist in some schools, which can allow agencies to make adjustments to bring about equality among students. Apart from academia purpose of education, making sure schools reflect the diversity of its residents is a top priority. Improving educational equity has long been a focus of society, especially New York City, where public schools remain some of the most segregated in the country. According to the New York City Council, “In New York City public schools, 74.6% of black and Hispanic students attend a school with less than 10% white students. Additionally, 34.3% of white students attend a school with more than 50% white students.” Apart from race and ethnicity, the segregation also can be found among different groups of gender, poverty and even students’ disability. Severe discrepancies still exist when breaking down the huge population of students and investigating their access to education and schools. In our project, we try to perform exploratory analysis of demographic school data in New York City from 2013- 2018 and answer questions as follows: Does the composition of ethnic groups correlate with the poverty rate of the student population? Is it more likely to have a lower poverty rate when the percentage of white students is higher? Does the number of total enrolled students correlate with the distribution of ethnic groups? For example, a bigger school has a more even composition of different ethnic groups (i.e. similar percentage for black, Asian, and white)? Does the composition of different genders correlate with the school’s poverty level? Do schools that have relatively higher poverty rates have more male students? Does the school level(eg. Primary school, middle school, high school) or ethic groups correlates? Does the distribution of schools in different districts have relations towards ethnic groups, gender groups and poverty level?

In the raw dataset of 2013 - 2018 Demographic Snapshot School, there exists several variables that worth investigating furthermore as follows: The data set contains attributes of the composition of different ethnicity groups and also one variable that describes the poverty level of the whole school (i.e. how many students are classified as poor), thus we can investigate the relationship between ethnicity composition and school’s overall poverty level; Since the data set provides the total number of enrolled students as well as variables describing the number of students from each ethnicity, we can investigate if the total number of students correlates with the relative composition of ethnicity among the student population; The data set has descriptions about the gender composition of the student population (i.e. number of males and female students in the school). Based on the variable about the poverty level of the school and the information about gender composition, we can draw inferences on their interactions; Finally, since New York City is a quite certain place for us to narrow down our investigation, we may use the school name to find their locations and districts. By combining the district information and the school’s poverty level, we can identify the locations where poverty level is relatively high. 2.1 Descriptive Analysis x DBN School.Name Year Total.Enrollment Grade.PK..Half.Day…Full.Day.

Categories variables including academic years, Grades, Gender and Race. More importantly, the datasets includes several heuristic metrics variables such as rate of disability students, English language learners, Economic need and Poverty to help us dive deeper into relationships between education and other interesting topics. 2.2 Issue with raw data The raw data didn’t explicitly give out the district or borough where each school locates. Therefore, we have to construct location variables in order to inspect the relationship between school locations and other topics; In the raw data, the type of school is not included. However, based on the data shown in different grades, we can conclude whether the school is a primary school, middle school or high school. Therefore, we may use the given information to classify different level of school in data transformation part.

Thus, we need to treat those entries as NAs. ## [1] Changing the &#39;No Data&#39; variable into NA ## [1] TRUE ## [1] The count of NA value is ## [1] 1730 ## [1] The percentage of NA value in &#39;Economic.Need.Index&#39; ## [1] &quot;0.49%&quot; 4.1 Missing Pattern plot Given the shear size of the dataset, it is hard to visualize missing value pattern of the whole dataset, thus, we can sample from the whole data set and visualize the missing pattern: After trying few cases of missing pattern combinations, it is really rare to find a case that have a pattern. This is because that the data itself has a really large size, which is 8972 rows by 39 columns, while there’s only 1730 missing entries, with a missing value rate less than 0.5%. Thus, we can say that the data set is overall complete.
