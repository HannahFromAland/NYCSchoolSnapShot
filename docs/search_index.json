[["index.html", "NYC School Snapshot Chapter 1 Introduction", " NYC School Snapshot Pinyi Yang &amp; Yuan Heng 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction Inequality, including racial, gender, disabilities, has always been a public problem, particularly in schools. In the past few years, there has been multiple incidents relating ethnicity inequalities. For example, George Floyd’s tragedy led to a wave of “Black Lives Matter” campaign; the death of Chinese student at Chicago university revealed a series of discriminating activities against Asian international students. Similarly, gender and disability discrimination are both common problems in schools. Preventing inequalities at school is especially important because students are really vulnerable, and being harmed by inequality will leave scars in their mental wellness. Thus, we aim to gain more insights about inequalities by investigating the distribution of ethnicity, gender, disability through other indicators in schools in New York. In this way, we can determine if inequalities exist in schools, which can allow agencies to make adjustments to bring about equality among students. Apart from academia purpose of education, making sure schools reflect the diversity of its residents is a top priority. Improving educational equity has long been a focus of the society, especially New York City, where public schools remain some of the most segregated in the country. According to the New York City Council, “In New York City public schools, 74.6% of black and Hispanic students attend a school with less than 10% white students. Additionally, 34.3% of white students attend a school with more than 50% white students.” Apart from race and ethnicity, the segregation also can be found among different groups of gender, poverty and even students’ disability. Severe discrepancies still exist when breaking down the huge population of students and investigating their access to education and schools. In our project, we try to perform exploratory analysis of demographic school data in New York City from 2013- 2018 and answer questions as follows: Does the composition of ethnic groups correlate with the poverty rate of the student population? Is it more likely to have a lower poverty rate when the percentage of white students is higher? Does the number of total enrolled students correlate with the distribution of ethnic groups? For example, a bigger school has a more even composition of different ethnic groups (i.e. similar percentage for black, Asian, and white)? Does the composition of different genders correlate with the school’s poverty level? Do schools that have relatively higher poverty rates have more male students? Does the school level(eg. Primary school, middle school, high school) or ethic groups correlates? Does the distribution of schools in different districts have relations towards ethnic groups, gender groups and poverty level? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis 2.2 Project goal 2.3 Issue with raw data", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data sets we are going to use in our analyses come from NYC Department of Education, and is open sourced on NYC Open Data, a popular website with various types of official data sets published by New York City agencies. The data is presented in a chronological order, from the 2013 academic year to the 2017 academic year, for each school in New York. 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis The raw data has 8972 observations of 39 variables. Categories variables including academic years, Grades, Gender and Race. More importantly, the datasets includes several heuristic metrics variables such as rate of disability students, English language learners, Economic need and Poverty to help us dive deeper into relationships between education and other interesting topics. 2.1.1 Data Column Summary Example Below is a table of summary statistics for the example columns, that are representative of the raw data set: Total.Enrollment represents the total number of students enrolled at the school in the specific academic year; Grade.K and Grade.12 are both student counts with K representing kindergarten and 12 representing grade 12 (i.e. senior of high school); Male.count as its name suggests is the number of males during the specific academic year at a given school, etc. Total.Enrollment Grade.K Grade.12 Male.count Asian.percentage Poverty.count Min. : 12.0 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.0 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 2.0 1st Qu.: 323.0 1st Qu.: 0.00 1st Qu.: 0.00 1st Qu.: 162.0 1st Qu.: 1.20 1st Qu.: 229.0 Median : 484.0 Median : 34.00 Median : 0.00 Median : 251.0 Median : 3.70 Median : 356.0 Mean : 598.2 Mean : 46.61 Mean : 38.54 Mean : 307.8 Mean :11.04 Mean : 435.6 3rd Qu.: 704.0 3rd Qu.: 83.00 3rd Qu.: 48.00 3rd Qu.: 369.0 3rd Qu.:12.90 3rd Qu.: 528.0 Max. :5838.0 Max. :406.00 Max. :1380.00 Max. :3478.0 Max. :94.70 Max. :3589.0 2.1.2 Enrollment (average across 2013-2018) Distribution After averaging the number of total enrollments for each school observed, we can generate the following histogram that shows the distribution of enrollment number of the schools. Based on the visualization, we can see that the majority of of schools (25th to 75th percentile) are clustered around the interval between 300 and 700. 2.1.3 Yearly Observation Count The barplot of yearly observation describes the number of observations taken each year. From the visualization, we can see that the number of schools taken into consideration varies from time to time, meaning that there are new schools being surveyed each year. This is an indication that if we were to conduct time series analysis, it will be difficult to generalize the year-to-year pattern for those schools that were not surveyed for the whole five academic years. We further created a visualization representing the distribution of number of observations per school, as shown below. 2.1.4 Number of Observations per School ## [1] &quot;The percentage of schools that have observations for all 5 academic years is 0.94&quot; From the visualization, we can see that not every school in the dataset is surveyed each year during the 5 academic years from 2013 to 2018, thus, data cleaning is needed if time series analysis is planned to be conducted. 2.2 Project goal In the raw dataset of 2013 - 2018 Demographic Snapshot School, there exists several variables that worth investigating furthermore as follows: The data set contains attributes of the composition of different ethnicity groups and also one variable that describes the poverty level of the whole school (i.e. how many students are classified as poor), thus we can investigate the relationship between ethnicity composition and school’s overall poverty level. We hypothesized that if the composition of a school includes higher proportion of minority ethnic groups, then there is a higher likelihood to have overall higher poverty level; \\[H_0: Ethnic\\ \\ composition \\not\\propto Poverty\\ \\ level\\] \\[H_a: Ethnic\\ \\ composition \\propto Poverty\\ \\ level\\] Since the data set provides the total number of enrolled students as well as variables describing the number of students from each ethnicity, we can investigate if the total number of students correlates with the relative composition of ethnicity among the student population. We hypothesized that, as the number of students at school increases, the relative proportion of each ethnic group would become more even; \\[H_0: Ethnic\\ \\ composition \\not\\propto school\\ \\ Population\\] \\[H_a: Ethnic\\ \\ composition \\propto school\\ \\ Population\\] The data set has descriptions about the gender composition of the student population (i.e. number of males and female students in the school). Based on the variable about the poverty level of the school and the information about gender composition, we can draw inferences on their interactions. We hypothesized that at school with higher proportion of poverty, the relative proportion of gender is more disproportionate; \\[H_0: Gender\\ \\ composition \\not\\propto school\\ \\ population\\] \\[H_a: Gender\\ \\ composition \\propto school\\ \\ population\\] Finally, since New York City is a quite certain place for us to narrow down our investigation, we may use the the DBN (District Borough Number) associated with each school to identify districts that the schools in each obervation belongs in. By combining the district information and the school’s poverty level, we can identify the locations where poverty level is relatively high. \\[H_0: Poverty\\ \\ level \\not\\propto School\\ \\ district\\] \\[H_a: Poverty\\ \\ level \\propto School\\ \\ district\\] 2.3 Issue with raw data The raw data didn’t explicitly give out the district or borough where each school locates. Therefore, we have to construct location variables that represents the school district in order to inspect the relationship between school locations and other topics; In the raw data, the type of school is not included. However, based on the data shown in different grades, we can conclude whether the school is a primary school, middle school or high school. Therefore, we may use the given information to classify different level of school in data transformation part. The data is presented in chronological order with each school having multiple observations (i.e. five academic years, including 2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018). However, not every school is surveyed each year, according to the Normalized School Observation Count Histogram above, which means time series analysis would be difficult for the minority of schools that have incomplete 5 year observations. Thus, in order to produce generalizable results, we shall remove schools that are “incomplete”. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Removing Incomplete Schools 3.2 Adding features", " Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Removing Incomplete Schools Before removing incomplete schools, the following table shows the number of schools for number of observation occurrences: Number of observations Number of schools 1 observation 19 school 2 observations 18 schools 3 observations 33 schools 4 observations 40 schools 5 observations 1718 schools Based on the exploratory data analysis result we obtained in the last chapter, we know that there are schools that does not have observation for each of the five academic years, which complicates analysis process if we want to conduct time series analysis. There are 1834 schools included in the data set and 1718 of them have observations for all five years, which constitutes over 93% of all schools. Thus, we choose to directly remove those schools that do not have full observations. 3.2 Adding features 3.2.1 Location of School Since the first column specifies DBN(District Borough Number) of each school, we firstly use it to generate a new location variable. According to the DBN assigning system, the Borough is the capitalized letter in the string. K represents Brooklyn district, Xrepresents the Bronx district, Q represents the Queens district, M represents the Manhattan district, and R represents the Staten Island district. During transformation, we used str_detect function in the stringr package to check for ocurrences of each Borough letter and assign the corresponding school with a location identifier in terms of the district. After specifying the location of school, we can first get a capture of school number in different Borough among different academic years in our data source. The number of schools by year and location are shown below: 3.2.2 Type of School As previously mentioned in Chapter2, we can use the number of students enrolled in different grades to judge the type of school. In the dataset, the number of students in different grade are measured from Grade PK to Grade 12. We use the criteria below to classify the type of School. Type of School Grades Included Pre School Learning Grade PK Elementary School From Grade k to Grade 5 Middle School From Grade 6 to Grade 8 High School From Grade 9 to Grade 12 The plot below shows the distribution of different school types at the five identified school districts: From the side by side proportion bar plot, we can see that the relative proportion of school types that each district have is quite stable. In other words, we can say that no school district have a preference for a certain school type, and the accessibility for all school levels is equal within each school district, regardless of inter-district difference in the prevalence of school types. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Checking Missing Values 4.2 Checking Inconsistent Values 4.3 Missing Pattern plot", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Checking Missing Values ## [1] &quot;After looping over all numerical variables, there&#39;s 0 NA values&quot; The data consist of different data types of parameters: numeric and character. For numerical variables, such as number of Asian student, number of Hispanic student, etc. a value of 0 is acceptable, since there might not be any student that belongs to that specific ethnic group, so we checked if there are any NA values in all variables that are numeric. It turned out that the data is pretty complete since there are no NA values for all numeric type variable. 4.2 Checking Inconsistent Values For character type variables, such as the Economic.Need.Index that represents numerical values in character format, we checked for missing values by converting the column of values to numeric after removing the % sign after the number. If there is no missing values, we should expect all values being converted to numbers. However, the conversion led to NA values for all observations, which indicate existence of values that are not NA but does not conform to the labeling format (i.e. string with number of percentages). Thus, to check for inconsistent values, we first mutate the Economic.Need.Index column by converting values that does not follow the format of \"numerical value %\" into NA. inconsistent &lt;- school %&gt;% mutate(Economic.Need.Index.new = ifelse(str_detect(Economic.Need.Index, &quot;^[\\\\d]+%&quot;), NA, as.numeric(str_extract(Economic.Need.Index, &quot;^[\\\\d]+&quot;)))) %&gt;% select(-c(DBN, X..Female.1, X..Male.1, X..Asian.1, X..Black.1, X..Hispanic.1, X..Multiple.Race.Categories.Not.Represented.1, X..White.1, X..Students.with.Disabilities.1, X..English.Language.Learners.1, X..Poverty.1, is_preschool, is_elementary, is_middle, is_high)) %&gt;% select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;% rename(Female = X..Female, Male = X..Male, Asian = X..Asian, Black = X..Black, Hispanic = X..Hispanic, Others = X..Multiple.Race.Categories.Not.Represented, White = X..White, Disabled.Students = X..Students.with.Disabilities, English.Learners = X..English.Language.Learners, Poverty = X..Poverty) print(paste0(&quot;The number of NAs, which was originally represented as No Data is &quot;, sum(is.na(inconsistent$Economic.Need.Index.new)), &quot; among the total of &quot;, length(inconsistent$Economic.Need.Index.new), &quot; observations&quot;)) ## [1] &quot;The number of NAs, which was originally represented as No Data is 1718 among the total of 8590 observations&quot; 4.3 Missing Pattern plot Given the shear size of the dataset, it is hard to visualize missing value pattern of the whole dataset, thus, we can sample from the whole data set and visualize the missing pattern: After trying few cases of missing pattern combinations, it is really rare to find a case that have a pattern. This is because that the data itself has a really large size, which is 8972 rows by 39 columns, while there’s only 1730 missing entries, with a missing value rate less than 0.5%. From the missing pattern plots, we can see that all the numerical columns except for Economic.Need.Index are complete. The missing values in Economic.Need.Index is not worrisome to us because Poverty parameter describes the same thing as Economic.Need.Index. So, we decided to completely remove the Economic.Need.Index column during further analysis, and use the complete Poverty column to represent economic statuses of the students. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Deep Dive of School Type 5.2 Analysis of school enrollment 5.3 School Diversity in NYC 5.4 Correlation Hypothesis and Analysis", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Deep Dive of School Type 5.1.1 Combination of School Type Many schools have multiple types of grade based on our criteria in Chapter 3. For example, some schools may have both pre-school grade and elementary school grade, and combinations of middle school and high school are also common. Therefore, we construct another factor variable type_str to specify all types containing by a school. The number of schools count by their complete type is distributed as follow: Clearly, the dataset doesn’t include schools that only provide pre-school education or there may not be demographic schools in New York City provide only pre-school learning. Generally speaking, the combination of school type is based on chronological order of grades. As we can see, the largest quantity of schools have combinations of pre-school learning and elementary school learning part. But surprisingly, there exists a sample of schools with combinations of elementary part and high school part. The dataset also contains 13 sample of schools which cover from pre-learning to high school grade. We will consider it together with the next part when investigating special schools provided for students with disability. 5.1.2 Special School for Students with Disability We use the metric of proportion of students with disability to determine whether a school can be considered as a speical school for students with disability. The histogram is right skewed, and with a peak around 100%. Most of demographic schools in New York City have less than 50% students with disability and the mean proportion is about 22%. Based on the distribution, we decide to set \\(50%\\) as a threshold to determine whether the school is a special school for students with disability. To explore more about this special type of schools, we focused on the grade type they provided inspired by the prior part. Remarks: Types of special schools for student with disability are also various. No special elementary school and middle school exists in the dataset, which indicates students with disability in New York City at this stage can involved in normal education together with their peers. The special school surely contributed more sample of schools with full range from pre learning to high school learning. From another perspective, they ensure the equity of achieving all stages of educations for students with disability. 5.2 Analysis of school enrollment By Location: The distribution of school enrollment by location is shown below. Most of schools in New York City have the number of students varies under quantity of 2000. Outliers of “large” schools which have students more than 2000 are more often located in Brooklyn and Queens, given they both have larger area and populations compared with the other three boroughs. By School Type: Since the type of number of grade a school includes can affect its student enrollment, we constructed boxplot to explore the enrollment of different type of schools. Apart from schools with coverage from pre-learning to high school learning(as stated before, most of them are special school for disability students), we can safely conclude that school with more grade level will have larger student enrollment in average. Therefore, schools provide elementary, middle school and high school level learning are generally have largest quantity of total enrollment since they includes 12 levels of grade. Outlier exist in several types, but high school type consists largest amount of outliers, and also tends to have extremely large number of enrollment, expanding from 1000 students to almost 6000 students. 5.3 School Diversity in NYC 5.3.1 Race and Ethnicity When it comes to diversity, race and ethnicity becomes the most popular topic. Here we use parallel coordinate plot to see whether there are correlations patterns in race group of public schools in New York City. From the percentage bar plot above, we can get a complete view of Race diversity and also its relationship to the location. In total, the percentage of Black and Hispanic students are overweighted than White students. According to NYC Race and Ethnicity data in 2021, more than 31.9 residents in NYC self-identified as white and non-Hispanic, while the majority of students in public schools are Hispanic and black. Breakdown of locations give us more insights about race and ethnicity issue. The composition of different ethnic groups clearly depends on the school district where the observed school locates in. For example, the proportion of white students enrolled in Staten Island takes almost half of the enrollment, while in other Borough especially Bronx, white students only constitute 4.2% of the total enrollment. This location-dependent ethnicity distribution indicates potential factors, such as social economical discrepancies, that drives families to send their children to a specific school district for school. This disproportionate distribution of ethnicity groups in different districts could serve as a warning to officials about possible discrimination to the minorities in the school. Thus, local agencies and school representatives need to take precaution about potential racial discrimination. Below we create a random sample of school to create a parallel coordinate plot. You can select, drag and reorder the columns to get a glimpse of race and ethnicity diversity in New York City public school. Hint: Try to select sample with higher percentage of Black students, what’s the pattern considering other race group and location? 5.3.2 School Type and Ethnicity Composition Given the location-dependent ethnicity distribution we discovered in the last section, we continued explore other indicators that may segregate different ethnic groups. The graph below shows the distribution of different ethnicity groups in different school types, where the school types were defined in a previous section. According to the stacked percentage barplot of ethnic group distribution in different school types, we can see high fluctuation of Asian and Black student proportions. Specifically, Black students have higher proportions in schools that are for Elementary, Middle, High Schools and Elementary, High schools, while lower proportions in schools that are identified as only Elementary schools. This difference in ethnicity distribution could indicate that discrepancy among students’ families’ social economical-status. School that are identified to contain multiple school types are usually public and can be subjected to higher chances of bullying, given the greater distribution of age groups. 5.3.3 Poverty Level Poverty is another factor worth considering when talking about school diversity. We first tried to capture a top-down view of Poverty Level using histogram. If the students are random selected to be enrolled in demographic schools, the distribution of their poverty level will be nearly normal distributed. Clearly, the distribution of proportion of poverty students are not normal distributed. By breakdown of location, most of distributions are right skewed except samples from Staten Island, and indicated that a majority of students in demographic schools are experiencing poverty. 5.3.4 English Language Learner English-language learners, or ELLs, are students who are unable to communicate fluently or learn effectively in English, who often come from non-English-speaking homes and backgrounds, and who typically require specialized or modified instruction in both the English language and in their academic courses. The number and proportion of English learner in public school reflects the diversity in Language and also can be a strong indication of race group and immigration living preference. Using the proportion of minority race group vs proportion of English Language Learner, we construct scatter plot with facet of different locations. By definition and clearly in plots, these two factors are positive correlated. Moreover, the sample size and the coefficient of correlation in Staten Island are both the smallest, which may indicate a minority of immigrants in this borough. 5.4 Correlation Hypothesis and Analysis As projected in Chapter 2, we proposed several relationships which can be further investigated through our dataset. In this section, we are going to look at the relationship between factors which affects school diversity given from different perspectives. 5.4.1 Poverty Rate and School Population Firstly, we care about the single influencer of Poverty level in public schools. Considering the size of school enrollment and poverty rate, we construct scatter plot to see whether there exists patterns, like larger school with high poverty level or vice versa. As the scatter plot shown, while the variance of sample from public schools are large, it is still possible to see the negative relationship between school size and poverty rate.Most of the public schools in NYC has an enrollment around 250-750 with a poverty ratre higher than 75%. Outliers exist in every dimensions, but there appears to be a straight line border with a negative slope above the collection of points in the plot when total enrollment is larger than 1000. 5.4.2 Three-way Interaction: Race Composition, Total Enrollment, Poverty As we hypothesized, ethnic composition may have strong relations with the proportion of students in poverty since the minority ethnic groups are more likely to be immigrants and has lower economics income. The result from scatter plots of ethic group breakdown supports our hypothesis. Apart from white students proportion, the sample of poverty and ethic group proportion are all positive correlated. Moreover, the slope steepness of positive correlation between poverty and proportion of Hispanic students is largest among four ethic groups, indicates that schools with higher proportion of Hispanic students are more likely to have higher poverty level. 5.4.3 Gender Composition and Poverty Recall our assumption in chapter 2, we try to explore the relationship between school poverty level and gender composition. Based on social conventions, we want to know whether gender bias in education can also be reflected by observations in NYC public schools. As we shown in poverty level before, most public schools in NYC have large quantity of students in poverty. However, though the poverty level is high, the average proportion of male students in NYC public schools are around 50%, which is a good sign indicating that there’s no bias when considering gender diversity and poverty level. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component The inspiration of the interactive plot comes from AnneThor’s treemap repository on Github. For further reference, please visit the link https://github.com/AnneThor/treemap 100 schools that are identified as richest, based on the proportion of poverty from 2017-2018 academic year, were selected for this interactive visualization. This interactive plot is a comprehensive description of the top 100 richest schools in New York City. If you hover the cursor over the box representing a school, you will be able to see the full name of the school, the school district that the school belongs to, and the number of students who were enrolled in the 2017-2018 academic year. We believe that this interactive plot can give more direct understanding about the school information, the student’s economic status, as well as geographical information about the school, which can consolidate your understanding about the entire project after seeing the analysis and visualizations from previous chapters.
