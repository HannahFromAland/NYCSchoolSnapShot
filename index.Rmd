# Introduction

In our project, we try to use exploratory analysis to answer questions as follows:

* Does the composition of ethnic groups correlate with the poverty rate of the student population? Is it more likely to have a lower poverty rate when the percentage of white students is higher?

* Does the number of total enrolled students correlate with the distribution of ethnic groups? For example, a bigger school has a more even composition of different ethnic groups (i.e. similar percentage for black, Asian, and white)?

* Does the composition of different genders correlate with the schoolâ€™s poverty level? Do schools that have relatively higher poverty rates have more male students?

* Does the school level(eg. Primary school, middle school, high school) or ethic groups correlates?

* Does the distribution of schools in different districts have relations towards ethnic groups, gender groups and poverty level?
